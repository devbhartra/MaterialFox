# Moonlight themed new and home tabs

This allows for the functionality to make dark moonlight themed home and new tabs as opposed to the default light theme offered in the original repository.

The inspiration is taken from: https://github.com/eduardhojbota/moonlight-userChrome.

I have used their variables file and userContent file to achieve the moonlight coloured tabs.

Additionaly I have used the extension firefox color to make the tabs match the theme as well. I picked colors from the official Dracula (https://github.com/eduardhojbota/moonlight-userChrome) hex codes.
